                    <div class="proposal-text">
                        <p>Alaska Digital Solutions Pvt Limited proposes technical solution as described below to Client for the requirements for Scanning and Digitization of Official Documents & Development of Cloud Based Document Management System:</p>
                        
                        <p>Alaska would deploy the efficient resources and scanners for capturing of documents, state of art Cloud Based Document Management Solution (DMS) with <strong>Hybrid mode</strong>. In Hybrid mode the DMS solution can be installed and accessed through cloud and local server/storage.</p>

                        <h2>Approach and Methodology Workflow:</h2>

                        <div class="workflow-steps">

                                <h3>1. Pre-Scanning work stage:</h3>
                                <p>The documents which are needed to be digitized and uploaded/accessed in controlled manner through DMS would be prepared for scanning work. In this stage the documents would be untied in controlled fashion and would be prepared for respective scanning stations. The resources deployed would do entries before untying the documents to ensure the document set information book keeping. The documents required would be treated before scanning if required.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>After the Pre-Scanning work, the documents would be sent to respective Scanning Stations for digitization stage. The required scanners for scanning of <strong>A0/A1/A2/A3/A4/Legal/A5</strong> size documents would be installed with required infrastructure as per requirements of Client. The documents/pages/maps/affidavits etc. of different sizes would be transformed/converted into digital format (both images and/or pdf) and archived with proper indexing for easy retrieval.</p>

                                <p>The scanned document would undergo in quality check stage to ensure the scanning and digitization specifications; if any document for which scanning work/meta data entry needs to be improvised would be scanned again for next stage. The book keeping of QC done documents would ensured by the resources deployed at the scanning center.</p>
